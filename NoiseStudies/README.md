# Noise Studies

This directory contains scripts to read in HiForest output and make plots for noise studies.

* adcDistributions.C makes ADC distributions for Time Slice 0 and Time Slice 1 for all ZDC+ and ZDC- channels (output is 4 PDFs).
* avg_charge_per_channel.C makes scatter plots showing the average charge (avg TS0 and avg TS1 charge) for each channel in ZDC+ and ZDC- (output is 2 .png plots).
* noise_correlations.C makes plots showing noise correlations between different time slices, specifically TS5, TS4, TS3, TS2, TS1 vs TS0 (output is 5 PDFs).
